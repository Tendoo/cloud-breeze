# Tendoo CMS
Tendoo CMS 5 is a new version of Tendoo CMS build with CodeIgniter.

The purpose of this project is to share with others the skills I've earned during my professional life on CodeCanyon and providing a better tool to create web application with all outstanding `Laravel`, `Vue2`, `Bootstrap-Material` features.
